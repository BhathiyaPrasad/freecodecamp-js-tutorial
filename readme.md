Now Its time Create A new Varuable to identify the inputs of computer Side because This game needed two persons 
Create a variable called computerMove 

                             Const computerMove ='';
                             Const computerMove1 = '';
                             Const computerMove2 = '';
                             
Then Created a Variable to store and output the final results
                            
                            let result = '';
                            let result1 = '';
                            let result2 = ''; 
                            
Created following variables in empthy to stores data from Algorhythm


Then Instead of using Console.log to get much more user experience the output method change to Alert Window to Display User's and Computer's Input and The final Results

                            alert('You Picked Rock'+' Computer Picked'+ ' ' + computerMove +' '+ result );

                             style="background-image: url(ImageName.jpg);   
Then added relative image for the bettter
